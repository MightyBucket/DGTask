# DGTask
Submission for technical interview task to Digital Genius

Inside there are two Python files. The `DHLtracker.py` module contains the two functions as specified in the task. Inside `main.py` is a simple script that shows them being used with a test tracking number. The address of the last tracking event is used to list nearby DHL locations within a radius of 1000m or 1km.
